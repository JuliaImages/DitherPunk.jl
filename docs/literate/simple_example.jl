#md # # DitherPunk.jl
#md # A [dithering / digital halftoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) package inspired by [Lucas Pope's Obra Dinn](https://obradinn.com) and [Surma's blogpost](https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/) of the same name.
#md #
#md # !!! note
#md #     This package is part of a wider [Julia-based image processing ecosystem](https://github.com/JuliaImages). If you are starting out, then you may benefit from reading about some [fundamental conventions](https://juliaimages.org/latest/quickstart/) that the ecosystem utilizes that are markedly different from how images are typically represented in OpenCV, MATLAB, ImageJ or Python.
#md #
# # Getting started
# We start out by loading an image, in this case the lighthouse
# from [*TestImages.jl*](https://testimages.juliaimages.org).
using DitherPunk
using Images
using TestImages

img_color = testimage("lighthouse")
img_color = imresize(img_color; ratio = 1//2)
img_gray = Gray.(img_color) # covert to grayscale

#
# !!! note " Preprocessing"
#     Sharpening the image and adjusting the contrast can emphasize the effect of the algorithms. It is highly recommended to play around with algorithms such as those provided by [ImageContrastAdjustment.jl](https://juliaimages.org/ImageContrastAdjustment.jl/stable/)
#
# ## Binary dithering
# Since we already turned the image to grayscale, we are ready to apply Bayer dithering,
# an [ordered dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering) algorithm that leads to characteristic cross-hatch patterns.
dither(img_gray, Bayer())

# ### Color spaces
# Depending on the method, dithering in sRGB color space can lead to results that are too bright.
# To obtain a dithered image that more closely matches the human perception of brightness, grayscale images can be converted to linear color space using the boolean keyword argument `to_linear`.
dither(img_gray, Bayer(); to_linear=true)

# ## Separate-space dithering
# All dithering algorithms in DitherPunk can also be applied to color images through the meta-method `SeparateSpace`.
# This method takes any dithering algorithm and applies channel-wise binary dithering.
dither(img_color, SeparateSpace(Bayer()))

# Any algorithm can be used, not only bayer dithering!
dither(img_color, SeparateSpace(FloydSteinberg()))
#
dither(img_color, SeparateSpace(Rhombus()))

#
# !!! note
#     Because the algorithm is applied once per channel, the output of this algorithm depends on the color type of input image. `RGB` is recommended, but feel free to experiment!
#
# ## Dithering with custom colors
# Let's assume we want to recreate an image by stacking ``50 \times 50`` Rubik's cubes. Dithering algorithms are perfect for this task!
# We start out by defining a custom color scheme:
white = RGB{Float32}(1, 1, 1)
yellow = RGB{Float32}(1, 1, 0)
green = RGB{Float32}(0, 0.5, 0)
orange = RGB{Float32}(1, 0.5, 0)
red = RGB{Float32}(1, 0, 0)
blue = RGB{Float32}(0, 0, 1)

rubiks_colors = [white, yellow, green, orange, red, blue]

# Now we only have to pick an image
img = testimage("fabio_color_256")
img = imresize(img, 150, 150)

# and run an `ErrorDiffusion` algorithm of our choice, e.g. `FloydSteinberg`:
d = dither(img, FloydSteinberg(), rubiks_colors)

# this looks much better than simply quantizing to the closest color!
d = dither(img, ClosestColor(), rubiks_colors)

# For an overview of all error diffusion algorithms, check out the [gallery].
#
# ### Using ColorSchemes.jl
# Predefined color schemes from [ColorSchemes.jl](https://juliagraphics.github.io/ColorSchemes.jl/stable/basics/#Pre-defined-schemes) can also be used by accessing the color scheme's `colors`.
# Here we use ColorSchemes.jl to dither in the colors of the Brazilian flag ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·:
using ColorSchemes
cs = ColorSchemes.flag_br

dither(img, Atkinson(), cs.colors)
